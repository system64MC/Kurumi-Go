# Kurumi - The Wavetable builder as powerful as vampires

A tool written in Go that lets you creating wavetables for various soundchips such as the Namco 163, the Konami SCC, the PC-Engine, etc...

It uses the power of FM Synthesis to produce the waveforms. There is also multiple filters such as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, ...

There is PWM, so you can turn your Namco 163 and your SCC into a Commodore 64 SID. You can even reproduce some AY-3 buzzer sounds.

Features :
 - 4 Operators FM Synthesis, with other modes such as :
    - OR
    - XOR
    - AND
    - NAND
    - ADD
    - SUB
    - MUL

 - Approximately 40 waveforms to choose from!
 - Arbitrary waveform per operator!
 - ADSR on volume/modulation level
 - ADSR on filters
 - Arbitrary volume/modulation level envelope
 - Detune
 - Phase
 - Arbitrary phase envelope
 - Modulation Matrix : Build your own algorithms!
 - 12 Algorithms presets for people that are used to Yamaha's algorithms
 - Pulse width modulation : Turn your wavetable chip into a SID!
 - ADSR on pulse width
 - Multiple filters such as lowpass, highpass, bandpass, ... to make your wavetable chip SID'ing even harder!
 - Export to dn-FamiTracker instrument
 - Export to Furnace Wavetable (.FUW)
 - Export to text
